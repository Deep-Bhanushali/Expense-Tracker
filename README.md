## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up the project locally.

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js (v18 or later recommended)

-   A PostgreSQL database (or you can switch to SQLite in `schema.prisma`)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash

cd Expense-Tracker
2. Install Dependencies
code

3. Set Up Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root of the project by copying the example file:
code
Bash
cp .env.example .env
Now, fill in the .env file with your database URL and NextAuth.js credentials:
```
Env
# This was inserted by `prisma init`:
# Environment variables declared in this file are automatically made available to Prisma.
# See the documentation for more detail: https://pris.ly/d/prisma-schema#accessing-environment-variables-from-the-schema

# Prisma
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://USERNAME:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE?schema=public"

# NextAuth.js
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="YOUR_NEXTAUTH_SECRET" # Generate a secret with: openssl rand -base64 32
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"

```
4. Push the Database Schema

(Optional) If you want to seed the database with initial categories, you can use Prisma's seed feature.
code
```Bash
npx prisma db seed
```
5. Run the Development Server
